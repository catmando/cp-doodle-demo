query -> goes to server

filters -> goes to store

filters: http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Store.html#method_filter

filter (type, query, filter)

looks like query can be either a simple object (number or string) in which case it treats the query as an :id and generates a GET /resource-name/:id/

or it can be a hash in which case it translates it to a query string of property=value pairs... i.e. GET /resource-name?prop=val&prop=val..

App.PostsFavoritedRoute = Ember.Route.extend({
  model: function() {
    var store = this.store;

    // Create a filter for all favorited posts that will be displayed in
    // the template. Any favorited posts that are already in the store
    // will be displayed immediately;
    // Kick off a query to the server for all posts that
    // the user has favorited. As results from the query are
    // returned from the server, they will also begin to appear.
    return store.filter('post', { favorited: true }, function(post) {
      return post.get('isFavorited');
    });
  }
});
